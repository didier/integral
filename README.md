# Integral

_Unstyled, composable and accessible Svelte components_

1. Unstyled (by default) ðŸ–Œ

   Integral aims to provide all components as-is, without styling. This way, you can use Integral to fit whatever design system you need. Everything can be easily customized with plain old CSS.

1. Composable ðŸ”£

   Integral aims to keep the syntax simple and composable. No weird methods, messing with indices or workarounds. Use these Svelte components like you would normally.

1. 100% (keyboard-)accessible ðŸ¥³

   The main goal for this project is to create accessible-by-default components, because accessibility is essential (maybe even _integral_) for any website or application and thus should be easy.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -D svelte-integral
# or
yarn add -D svelte-integral
```

## Usage

```html
<script>
  /* Supports SSR by default! No `svelte-integral/src/lib/Tabs.svelte` nonsense. */
  import { Tab, Tabs } from 'svelte-integral'
</script>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="One">I'm the first tab, so I'm being shown by default.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Two">Hey! I'm number two, now back to you!</Tab>
  <Tab title="Three">Number three, look at me!</Tab>
  <Tab title="Four">Four. What's more?</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

```html
<script>
  import { Modal } from 'svelte-integral'

  let open = false
</script>

<!-- You can bind the `open` state to whatever you like, and it updates accordingly. -->
<Modal bind:open>
  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
</Modal>
```
